Hi there, 
[Jan-2022] I am working on a side [project](https://github.com/somsubhro/firehosesensing) to see if we can build a better way to ingest AWS release news. This is not a AWS project and all work is my own.

I am currently a `Technical Program Manager` within [AWS Commerce Platform](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/aws-commerce-platform). My work brings me close to cost management, cost control, and cost analytics domains, as well close to bunch of cool, smart people. I often spend time with primitives of AWS, like IAM. I like to share my learnings of learning AWS/cloud. I share my takes in [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somsubhrochatterjee/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/SomsubhroChatte). 

I am (re)learning to `code`

My favorite [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (.zshrc) theme is `gnzh` when using default color space on macOS terminal.exe. If I am using iTerm2, I use it with [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color preset and `agnoster` theme ü•á

### Struggles

My struggles should make a longer list than my achievements or contributions. I struggled with `homebrew` on `zsh` shell. I struggled with exiting running processes from macOS terminals. I struggled with getting out of the `nano` prompt on terminal. I have struggled with (nearly wrestled with) getting Jekyll to work to publish static website on Github Pages (hence this). I still struggle with any kind of javascript. I struggled with finding the ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è emoji. I struggle with the internet. But I am getting there, hang tight!

When I am not having writer's block (mine should be more famous than that of [Fran's](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/28/fran-lebowitz-if-people-disagree-with-me-so-what)) I publish my thoughts at [Medium](https://somchat.medium.com/) and sometimes tickle my funny bone at [Wordpress](https://scnotmycupoftea.wordpress.com/)
