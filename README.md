Hi there. I am currently working on a side [project, codename: Firehosesensing](https://github.com/somsubhro/firehosesensing) to see if we can build a better way to ingest AWS releases. This is not a AWS project and all work is my own.

I am `Technical Program Manager` within AWS Commerce Platform. My work brings me close to cost management, cost control, and cost analytics domains, as well close to bunch of cool, smart people. As a side gig, I often spend time with primitives of AWS, like IAM. I like to share my learnings of learning AWS/cloud. I share my takes in [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somsubhrochatterjee/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/SomsubhroChatte). 

Currently, I am (re)learning to code in **Python**. I am learning **React.js** too.
