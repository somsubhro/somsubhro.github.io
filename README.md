Hi there,

I am currently a `Software Development Manager` within [AWS Commerce Platform](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/aws-commerce-platform). My team and I [launched](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/11/aws-pricing-calculator-estimates-purchase-commitments-discounts/) the new AWS Pricing Calculator (circa Nov 2024). My work brings me close to cost management, cost control, and cost analytics domains, as well close to bunch of very smart people. I often spend time with primitives of AWS, like IAM. I like to share my learnings of learning AWS/cloud. I share my takes in [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/somsubhrochatterjee/). 

I am (re)learning to `code`

My favorite [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (.zshrc) theme is `gnzh` when using default color space on macOS terminal.exe. If I am using iTerm2, I use it with [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color preset and `agnoster` theme ü•á

### Struggles

My struggles should make a longer list than my achievements or contributions. I struggled with `homebrew` on `zsh` shell. I struggled with exiting running processes from macOS terminals. I struggled with getting out of the `nano` prompt on terminal. I have struggled with (nearly wrestled with) getting Jekyll to work to publish static website on Github Pages (hence this). I still struggle with any kind of javascript. I struggled with finding the ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è emoji. I struggle with the internet. But I am getting there, hang tight!

When I am not having writer's block (mine should be more famous than that of [Fran's](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/28/fran-lebowitz-if-people-disagree-with-me-so-what)) I publish my thoughts at [Medium](https://somchat.medium.com/) and sometimes tickle my funny bone at [Wordpress](https://scnotmycupoftea.wordpress.com/)
