#### S3 bucket names

Just making sure, that we all understand this that:ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ‘‡

*"An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by **all AWS accounts**. This means that after a bucket is created, the name of that bucket cannot be used by another AWS account in any AWS Region until the bucket is deleted"* - From [this Buckets overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html)

This means `trial-bucket` is a name you cannot create a bucket with, even if a bucket with that name does not exist in your account. `trial-bucket` has been used by some one, some where. Go ahead, give it a try. ðŸ¤¯

This is also why, if you are trying to create a s3 bucket, you may see this error message (or a version of it):
`An error occurred (IllegalLocationConstraintException) when calling the CreateBucket operation: The unspecified location constraint is incompatible for the region specific endpoint this request was sent to.`

#### XHTML syntax for inserting code blocks in XHTML based wikis as an example

First, insert `DOCTYPE` before the `<head>` tag of the page if it is not existing. This will ensure that the browser uses a strict formatting, and is backward compatible. Without the `DOCTYPE` browsers use [quirks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode) mode (before web standards). I have used "strict" DTD. You can choose to use any one of the 3 available [DTDs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xhtml/xhtml_doctypes.htm)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

<head>
  ....
</head>
```

Next, wrap your text that you want to represent within code block with `<pre>... Your text ... </pre>` tags. That simple. Took me a whole day trying with `<code>`, `<samp>`, `<kbd>`

<pre>
  code block
  code block
</pre>
